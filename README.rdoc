== README

This is a recreation of thoughtbot's ios-on-rails book application "Humon".

Things added are authentication with sorcery and authorization with pundit.

The URIs conform to heroku's api styleguide, so the version is communicated in the header.

The API is fully tested with request specs.

API documentation is managed via apipie. 
See http://localhost:3000/apipie for details.
